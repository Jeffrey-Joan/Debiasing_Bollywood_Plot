# Debiasing_Bollywood_Plot

In this project , we will be removing the gender bias present in the bollywood plot dataset . The notebook uses the techniques and methodology used in the paper : (Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings) [https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf].

We remove the bias by equalising gender-specific terms and neutralize gender biased words .

The paradigms used to achieve the objective is elucidated in the notebook .
